# Video Scripts
I'm working on a video series alongside the development of this engine. This folder contains written scripts, snippets, todos, sketches, etc... relating to that. 

Not everything here is complete or represents the final versions of the videos,

The videos are mostly lighthearted, but I do occasionally explain some concepts or the rationale behind decisions made, so having its written-form up here on the repo might be useful to someone.
